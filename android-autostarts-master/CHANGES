    * Updated to support 4.4/KitKat.
    * Vastly improve loading speed.
    * Do not block UI during state change, process in background.

    I am aware of the issues with Xperia devices. These will be fixed

1.7.7 (2012-08-14)
    Only released on Vodaphone AppSelect. Removes root functionality.

1.7.6 (2012-07-30)
    Only released on Vodaphone AppSelect. Removes the "Find in Market"
    option.

1.7.5 (2011-12-10)
    This release mostly fixes ICS/Android 4.0 issues, and drops support
    for Android 1.5.

    * On ICS, the Enabled/Disabled option was sometimes incorrectly
      labeled.
    * On ICS, state-toggling would generally not work, and show
      the standard failure message.
    * On ICS, sometimes state-toggling could crash the app.
    * Translation updates, including some new translations, Italian and
      Polish. Thanks to LucaTrev and Adammo, respectively, for their
      extensive work on this.

1.7.1 (2011-04-22)
    Only released on Amazon Appstore. Introduces a separate build series
    that contains a "Find in Appstore" option, replacing "Find in Market".

1.7.0 (2011-03-24)
    * Added a new "Group by application" view.
    * It's no longer necessary to manually keep ADB Debugging enabled.
    * If signed with the system certificate, use Android's official APIs
      rather than root access. This won't be relevant for most users, but
      is useful when compiling a custom Android.
    * Added new events from 2.3 and 3.0.
    * Easier scrolling via a draggable thumb, as known from the Contacts
      app.
    * Fixed "Application Info" option on Gingerbread.
    * Russian translation (Andrew Ivanchenko).
    * Use the new Honecomb-theme on 3.0 devices.

1.6.2 (2010-11-26)
    * Fixed: Occasionally, apps could not be disabled, and an "you might
      not have root" messages was accidentally shown (thanks to Dan Feigt).

1.6.1 (2010-08-29)
    * No longer ask for INTERNET permission.
    * Re-release without Market copy protection.

1.6.0 (2010-05-22)
    * Retired our custom crash reporting in favor of Google's new
      built-in reporting facility (available starting with Froyo).
    * Support installation on SD card.
    * Added support for a number broadcasts new in Android 2.2.

1.5.7 (2010-05-11)
    * Fixed a stupid bug introduced in the last commit that broke
      orientation change and potentially caused crashes.

1.5.6 (2010-05-04)
    * Work around an Android bug that caused Autostarts to crash when
      processing certain packages that are advertised as being installed,
      but really are broken.

1.5.5 (2010-03-26)
    * Included higher resolution icons for HDPI screens, looks nicer now.
    * Automated exception-reporting functionality.
    * Very slightly improved progressbar behavior during orientation
      change.

1.5.3 (2010-02-23)
    * Show a warning before disabling Google Talk with respect to Market
      downloads.
    * Fixed display of component labels (a regression introduced in the
      1.5.0 backend refactor).
    * Improved way of using the root access; should work on more devices
      now, including the Archos devices and the Sholes Droid Mod.

1.5.0 (2010-02-10)
    * Major rewrite of how we retrieve package information. We no longer
      need to keep track of disabled components ourselves, and an uninstall
      of Autostarts no longer is an issue. The new backend also makes
      it possible for us to show additional events that are not in our
      database. Last but not least we can now show components that are
      disabled by default, and make a clean distinction between that
      initial state and changes by the user.
    * Compiled against 2.1 SDK.
    * Included pretty names and descriptions for a large number of new
      events.

1.2.2 (2010-01-31)
    * Added German translation (does not include event texts).
    * Added support for two new events (SECRET_CODE, SPN_STRINGS_UPDATED).
    * Improved handling of certain events (like PACKAGE_INSTALLED and
      friends) that previously didn't properly show up in many cases.
      There is still some work to do here.
    * On first use and on the help screen we now show information about
      how to workaround the freeze bug in the Superuser Whitelist app.

1.2.1 (2009-10-29)
    * "Eclair-ready" (compiled against 2.0).
    * Support all screen sizes.
    * Support various new events introduced in 1.6 and 2.0.

1.2.0 (2009-10-17)
    * Fixed a pretty serious crash on almost every orientation change.
    * Added option to only show disabled components.

1.1.9 (2009-10-05)
    * Warn the user more clearly about the dangers of uninstalling the
      app while components are still disabled.
    * Support orientation change.
    * Minor architecture improvements under the hood, preparing for
      bigger things to come.

    * Support missing camera.NEW_PICTURE intent.
    * Improved logging when an error occurs during component state change,
      to allow investigating problems.
